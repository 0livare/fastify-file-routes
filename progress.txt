(Patterns discovered during implementation)

## Test Setup (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Installed vitest and @vitest/ui for testing infrastructure
- Created vitest.config.ts with node environment and coverage settings
- Added test, test:watch, test:ui, and typecheck scripts to package.json
- Created sample test file at src/__tests__/sample.test.ts to verify setup
- Updated tsconfig.json to exclude router-cli directory from type checking
- Formatted all files with prettier to ensure consistent code style
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Using vitest instead of jest for modern ESM support and speed
- Excluded router-cli directory from tsconfig as it's example code with missing dependencies
- Added both test:watch and test:ui scripts for development flexibility

## Core Path Mapping (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/path-mapper.ts with filePathToUrlPath function
- Implemented core logic to convert file paths to URL paths following Tanstack Router conventions
- Handles route parameters with both $ and .$ syntax (e.g., $userId and .$userId → :userId)
- Handles index files that map to parent path
- Handles pathless layouts (underscore prefix) that are excluded from URL path
- Strips src/api prefix from all generated URLs
- Strips HTTP method suffixes (.get.ts, .post.ts, etc.)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 33 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (33/33)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Implemented as a pure function that takes a file path and returns a URL path
- Used string manipulation and array filtering for clean, readable code
- Comprehensive test coverage including basic paths, parameters, index files, pathless layouts, and complex nested scenarios
- Function returns string | null to allow for potential invalid path handling in future

**Files Created:**
- src/path-mapper.ts (62 lines)
- src/__tests__/path-mapper.test.ts (178 lines, 33 tests)

## HTTP Method Extraction (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/method-extractor.ts with extractHttpMethod function
- Implemented function to extract HTTP method from filename suffix (e.g., '.get.ts' → 'GET')
- Supports all standard REST methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Supports both .ts and .js file extensions
- Returns null for files without valid method suffixes
- Case-insensitive matching (e.g., .GET.ts, .get.ts, .GeT.ts all work)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 26 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (59/59 total across all test files)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Used regex pattern to match .method.(ts|js) at end of filename
- Implemented case-insensitive matching with case-fold flag in regex
- Exported HttpMethod type for type safety in consuming code
- Returns null instead of throwing for invalid inputs
- Function works with full paths, relative paths, and bare filenames

**Files Created:**
- src/method-extractor.ts (31 lines)
- src/__tests__/method-extractor.test.ts (148 lines, 26 tests)
