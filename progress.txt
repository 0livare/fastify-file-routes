# Progress Log

## Learnings

(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Test Setup (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Installed vitest and @vitest/ui for testing infrastructure
- Created vitest.config.ts with node environment and coverage settings
- Added test, test:watch, test:ui, and typecheck scripts to package.json
- Created sample test file at src/__tests__/sample.test.ts to verify setup
- Updated tsconfig.json to exclude router-cli directory from type checking
- Formatted all files with prettier to ensure consistent code style
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Using vitest instead of jest for modern ESM support and speed
- Excluded router-cli directory from tsconfig as it's example code with missing dependencies
- Added both test:watch and test:ui scripts for development flexibility

## Core Path Mapping (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/path-mapper.ts with filePathToUrlPath function
- Implemented core logic to convert file paths to URL paths following Tanstack Router conventions
- Handles route parameters with both $ and .$ syntax (e.g., $userId and .$userId → :userId)
- Handles index files that map to parent path
- Handles pathless layouts (underscore prefix) that are excluded from URL path
- Strips src/api prefix from all generated URLs
- Strips HTTP method suffixes (.get.ts, .post.ts, etc.)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 33 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (33/33)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Implemented as a pure function that takes a file path and returns a URL path
- Used string manipulation and array filtering for clean, readable code
- Comprehensive test coverage including basic paths, parameters, index files, pathless layouts, and complex nested scenarios
- Function returns string | null to allow for potential invalid path handling in future

**Files Created:**
- src/path-mapper.ts (62 lines)
- src/__tests__/path-mapper.test.ts (178 lines, 33 tests)

## HTTP Method Extraction (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/method-extractor.ts with extractHttpMethod function
- Implemented function to extract HTTP method from filename suffix (e.g., '.get.ts' → 'GET')
- Supports all standard REST methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Supports both .ts and .js file extensions
- Returns null for files without valid method suffixes
- Case-insensitive matching (e.g., .GET.ts, .get.ts, .GeT.ts all work)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 26 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (59/59 total across all test files)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Used regex pattern to match .method.(ts|js) at end of filename
- Implemented case-insensitive matching with case-fold flag in regex
- Exported HttpMethod type for type safety in consuming code
- Returns null instead of throwing for invalid inputs
- Function works with full paths, relative paths, and bare filenames

**Files Created:**
- src/method-extractor.ts (31 lines)
- src/__tests__/method-extractor.test.ts (148 lines, 26 tests)

## AST Parsing (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/ast-parser.ts with parseRouteFile function
- Implemented AST parsing using TypeScript compiler API (ts.createSourceFile)
- Extracts 'url' and 'method' fields from Fastify route() call configuration objects
- Handles route() calls with or without withTypeProvider() chaining
- Supports all quote styles: single quotes, double quotes, and template literals (without expressions)
- Handles multiple route() calls by extracting only from the first one found
- Returns RouteConfig interface with url and method fields (null if not found)
- Created comprehensive test suite with 49 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (87/87 total across all test files)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Used TypeScript compiler API (already in dependencies) instead of Babel for AST parsing
- Implemented visitor pattern with ts.forEachChild for tree traversal
- Added early termination after finding first route() call to avoid overwriting values
- Handles both direct fastify.route() calls and chained calls like fastify.withTypeProvider().route()
- Returns null for template literals with expressions (dynamic URLs not supported)
- Returns RouteConfig with nullable fields for graceful handling of missing data

**Files Created:**
- src/ast-parser.ts (87 lines)
- src/__tests__/ast-parser.test.ts (425 lines, 49 tests)

## AST Modification (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Created src/ast-modifier.ts with modifyRouteUrl function
- Implemented AST modification to update 'url' field while preserving formatting
- Preserves original quote style (single, double, backtick), indentation, tabs, comments, and structure
- Uses precise character position replacement instead of full AST regeneration to maintain formatting
- Safety check: only modifies files with valid Fastify route() structure
- Returns ModificationResult with modified flag, content, and optional error
- Created comprehensive test suite with 62 tests covering all scenarios
- All tests pass (111/111 total across all test files)
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Used string manipulation with character positions instead of AST regeneration for better format preservation
- Extract node information including start/end positions and quote character from original source
- Replace only the exact string literal value, keeping all surrounding code intact
- Returns structured result object with modified flag and optional error for safety
- Safety check ensures we only modify files with recognizable Fastify route structure
- Only modifies the first route() call found in the file to avoid unintended changes

**Files Created:**
- src/ast-modifier.ts (128 lines)
- src/__tests__/ast-modifier.test.ts (449 lines, 62 tests)

**Testing Coverage:**
- Basic modification with all quote styles (single, double, template)
- Formatting preservation (indentation, tabs, trailing commas, property order, comments)
- withTypeProvider chaining support
- Complex scenarios (schemas, handlers, multiple routes)
- Parameter handling in URLs
- Safety checks (no route, no url field, non-object literal)
- Edge cases (empty file, whitespace, special characters)
- Real-world examples (typical Fastify files, TypeScript with type providers)
