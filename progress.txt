## Test Setup (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Summary:**
- Installed vitest and @vitest/ui for testing infrastructure
- Created vitest.config.ts with node environment and coverage settings
- Added test, test:watch, test:ui, and typecheck scripts to package.json
- Created sample test file at src/__tests__/sample.test.ts to verify setup
- Updated tsconfig.json to exclude router-cli directory from type checking
- Formatted all files with prettier to ensure consistent code style
- All checks pass: typecheck, test, and lint

**Key Decisions:**
- Using vitest instead of jest for modern ESM support and speed
- Excluded router-cli directory from tsconfig as it's example code with missing dependencies
- Added both test:watch and test:ui scripts for development flexibility
